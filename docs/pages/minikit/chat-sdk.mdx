# MiniKit + Vercel Chat SDK

This guide explains how to integrate the Chat SDK with your MiniKit application, providing you with a powerful solution for adding chat functionality to your application.

> **Note:** This documentation is adapted from the [official Chat SDK documentation by Vercel](https://chat-sdk.dev/docs/getting-started/setup). For the most up-to-date information, please refer to the official source.

## Setup

There are two ways to set up the Chat SDK. Deploying with Vercel is the fastest way to get started by having a live deployment up and running, while also being able to develop locally immediately.

### Use 1-click Deploy with Vercel and Develop Locally

1. Enter the 1-click deploy flow using [this link](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fvercel%2Fai-chatbot&env=AUTH_SECRET&envDescription=Generate%20a%20random%20secret%20to%20use%20for%20authentication&envLink=https%3A%2F%2Fgenerate-secret.vercel.app%2F32&project-name=my-awesome-chatbot&repository-name=my-awesome-chatbot&demo-title=AI%20Chatbot&demo-description=An%20Open-Source%20AI%20Chatbot%20Template%20Built%20With%20Next.js%20and%20the%20AI%20SDK%20by%20Vercel&demo-url=https%3A%2F%2Fchat.vercel.ai&).
2. Create new project and repository of the Chat SDK
3. Add integrations like Neon Postgres and xAI Grok to your project
4. Clone your repository locally and link to your project using `vc link`
5. Link environment variables using `vc env pull`
6. Continue development locally
7. Push changes and recreate deployment automatically

### Required Environment Variables

The Chat SDK requires several environment variables similar to [MiniKit environment setup](/minikit/existing-app#step-4-env). The key variables are:

| Category                    | Key Variables                                         |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Database (Neon Postgres)    | `DATABASE_URL`, `POSTGRES_URL`, `POSTGRES_HOST`, etc. |
| Storage (Vercel Blob store) | `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN`                               |
| AI Provider                 | `XAI_API_KEY`                                         |

> For detailed environment variable management and deployment practices, see the [MiniKit Existing App Integration guide](/minikit/existing-app#step-7-vercel).

### Develop Locally and Deploy Later

1. Fork the Chat SDK repository on GitHub
2. Clone your forked repository locally
3. Create a PostgreSQL database and retrieve its connection string to set the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable in `.env.local`
4. Create a Vercel Blob store and set the `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` environment variable in `.env.local`
5. Sign up for a developer account on xAI's portal and create a new API key to set the `GROK_API_KEY` environment variable in `.env.local`
6. Install dependencies using `pnpm install`
7. Start development server using `pnpm dev`

## Integrating with MiniKit

After setting up the Chat SDK, you can integrate it with your MiniKit application following similar steps to the [MiniKit Provider setup](/minikit/existing-app#step-2-minikit-provider):

1. Import the necessary components from the Chat SDK
2. Add the Chat SDK provider to your MiniKit application
3. Customize the chat interface to match your application's design
4. Configure the AI model and behaviors to suit your use case

This integration allows your MiniKit application to have powerful chat capabilities while maintaining the benefits of the MiniKit framework for Farcaster.

For more details on customization options and advanced features, refer to the [official Chat SDK documentation](https://chat-sdk.dev/docs/).
