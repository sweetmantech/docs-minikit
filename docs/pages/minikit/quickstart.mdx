## Quick Start

The fastest way to get started with MiniKit is to use the CLI to bootstrap a new project:

```bash
npx create-onchain --mini
```

You can also follow the [quick start section in the official docs](https://docs.base.org/builderkits/minikit/quickstart?utm_source=sweetman&utm_medium=x&utm_campaign=minikit2&utm_id=ddr)

This command will:

1. Set up a new project with both frontend and backend components
2. Configure webhooks and notifications
3. Set up account association generation
4. Create a demo app showcasing onchain abilities using OnchainKit

After running the command, follow the prompts to configure your project.

We recommend using Vercel to deploy your MiniKit app, as it integrates seamlessly with the upstash/redis backend required for frames, webhooks, and notifications. The CLI will guide you through setting up the necessary environment variables for your Redis database.
